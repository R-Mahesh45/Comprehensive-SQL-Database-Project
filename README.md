Description :- 
This project is a comprehensive SQL database system that demonstrates the creation, management, and execution of various SQL operations. The main goal is to showcase proficiency in SQL through a series of structured tasks, including database design, data manipulation, and transaction management. The project emphasizes key concepts like ACID properties, data integrity, and efficient querying.
Features :- 
Schema Creation: Design and implementation of normalized database schemas.
Data Insertion and Updates: Includes scripts for adding initial data and performing updates.
Complex Queries: Demonstrates complex SQL queries such as joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
Transaction Management: Full transaction handling with BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to ensure atomicity and consistency.
Data Integrity: Use of constraints like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK to maintain data reliability.
ACID Compliance: Ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability throughout the database operations.
Technologies Used :-
SQL: Core technology for database operations.
RDBMS: Tested and executed on [e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server].
Version Control: Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
Project Structure :-
schema.sql: SQL script for creating the database schema.
data_insertion.sql: Scripts for inserting initial data.
transactions.sql: Scripts for handling transactions and demonstrating ACID properties.
complex_queries.sql: Collection of complex SQL queries.
README.md: Detailed documentation of the project.
Getting Started
To run the project:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Run schema.sql to set up the database.
Execute data_insertion.sql to populate initial data.
Use transactions.sql to observe transaction management in action.
Test additional queries from complex_queries.sql as needed.
Use Cases
Financial transaction simulations
Data management systems
Educational demonstration for learning SQL concepts
Future Enhancements
Add stored procedures and triggers for automated operations.
Integrate performance optimization techniques.
Expand the project with more complex use cases and indexing strategies.
